Problem Statement

Sherlock is given an array of N integers A0, A1 ... AN-1 by Watson. Now Watson asks Sherlock how many different pairs of indices i and j exist such that i is not equal to j but Ai is equal to Aj.

That is, Sherlock has to count total number of pairs of indices (i, j) where Ai = Aj AND i ≠ j.

Input Format 
First line contains T, the number of testcases. T test case follows. 
Each testcase consists of two lines, first line contains an integer N, size of array. 
Next line contains N space separated integers.

Output Format 
For each testcase, print the required answer in different line.

Constraints 
1 ≤ T ≤ 10 
1 ≤ N ≤ 105 
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 106

Explanation 
In the first testcase, no two pair of indices exist which satisfy the given property. 
In second testcase as A[0] = A[1] = 1, the pairs of indices (0,1) and (1,0) satisfy the given property.
