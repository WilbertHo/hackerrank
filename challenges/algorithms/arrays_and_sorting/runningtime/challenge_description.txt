Challenge 
Can you modify your previous Insertion Sort implementation to keep track of
the number of shifts it makes while sorting? The only thing you should print
is the number of shifts made by the insertion sort algorithm to completely
sort the array. A shift occurs when an element's position changes in the
array. (Do not shift an element if it is not necessary.)

Input Format 
The first line contains N, the number of elements to be sorted. The next line
contains N integers a[1],a[2]...,a[N].

Output Format 
Output the number of shifts it takes.

Constraints 
1<=N<=1001 
-10000 <= x <= 10000 , x âˆˆ a

Sample Input 
5 
2 1 3 1 2

Sample Output 
4

Explanation 
The first '1' is shifted once. The '3' stays where it is. The next '1' gets
shifted twice. The final '2' gets shifted once. Hence, the total number of
shifts is 4.

Task 
For this problem, you can copy your code from the InsertionSort problem, and
modify it to keep track of the number of shifts, instead of printing the
array.
